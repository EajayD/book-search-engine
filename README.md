This is a simple application that utilizes an entire MERN stack convention with a React front end, MongoDB database and Node and Express packages to allow a user to search and save books to a personal profile. A User can save and remove books from their profile. The application utilizes Javascript Webtokens (JWT) as an authentication tool to make each user that is created and/or logged in unique. It is also implementing the GraphQL and Apollo Server to do what Restful APIs would usually do by getting/adding a user, logging in a user, and saving/removing books from a profile.
